# UFOs

## Overview

- The purpose of this project is to create a webpage where we can filter through a specific dataset of UFO sightings. We have added multiple filters to the table of data. These filters include the date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary

- To perform a search, you click in the field for the criteria you are interested in. There is an example in each filter box so that you know how you are expected to enter the criteria yourself. Once you type in the filtered criteria, you click enter. The filtered dataset can then be seen on the right. An example of this can be seen in the below image.
